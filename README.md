# NYC Parades

Using the [NYC Permitted Events data set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Permitted-Event-Information/tvpp-9vvx), page should display what events currently have a permit set up.

## Motivation

I'm an avid street/documentary photographer that is usually roaming around the city in my free time with a camera. I'm not an event photographer, but the amount of events and parades that goes on in the city affords me opportunities to document energy and scenes I normally wouldn't get. 

Also to qualify in renewing my NYC press card, I need to have 6 events documented, so theres some practical motivation.

While I can't put into words the sights one might see at a NYC parade, maybe some people who have documented in video form can:

* [Paulie B: Easter day parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT0dYvMoRQI)
* [Jared Winslow: St. Patrick's Day parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psASezft9Eg)
